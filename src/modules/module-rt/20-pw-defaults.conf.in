# This file was installed by PipeWire project for buffer locking to always work

# Required to memlock audio buffers for all client types
#
# This will match all PAM users i.e. those going through the login procedure but
# it should not get applied to system daemons, since they are run bypassing PAM.
#
# While at first glance this might appear very relevant, in fact abusing this
# can at most allow for either more rapid OOM or enhance malicious system memory
# thrashing while evading systemd-oomd limits that are based on the requirement
# that swap utilization must be high before issues arise. As such it's perfectly
# reasonable to just set a limit where each client can lock a few megabytes with
# nearly no impact on regular systems. Meanwhile malicious attackers can OOM
# just as they could. And instead tooling for OOM and resource abuse should be
# improved, if such denial of service attacks are a serious consideration at all.
#
# Starting with Linux 5.16 or systemd v253 the default is 8192 which is plenty
# good enough and this file should not be installed on such systems.
