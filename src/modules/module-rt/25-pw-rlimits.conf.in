# It is up to the distribution/user to create the @MATCH@ group and to add the
# relevant users to the group.
#
# PipeWire will fall back to the RTKit DBus service when the user is not able to
# acquire RT priorities with rlimits.
#
# If the group is not automatically created, the match rule will never be true
# and this file will have no effect.
