SYNOPSIS
========

| **pw-cli** [*command*]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Interact with a PipeWire instance.

When a command is given, **pw-cli**
will execute the command and exit

When no command is given, **pw-cli**
starts an interactive session with the default PipeWire instance
*pipewire-0*.

Connections to other, remote instances can be made. The current instance
name is displayed at the prompt.

Note that **pw-cli** also creates a local PipeWire instance. Some commands
operate on the current (remote) instance and some on the local instance, such
as module loading.

Use the 'help' command to list the available commands.

GENERAL COMMANDS
================

help | h
  Show a quick help on the commands available. It also lists the aliases
  for many commands.

quit | q
  Exit from **pw-cli**

MODULE MANAGEMENT
=================

| Modules are loaded and unloaded in the local instance, thus the pw-cli
| binary itself and can add functionality or objects to the local
| instance. It is not possible in PipeWire to load modules in another
| instance.

load-module *name* [*arguments...*]
  Load a module specified by its name and arguments in the local instance.
  For most modules it is OK to be loaded more than once.

  This command returns a module variable that can be used
  to unload the module.

  The locally module is *not* visible in the remote instance. It is not
  possible in PipeWire to load modules in a remote instance.

unload-module *module-var*
  Unload a module, specified either by its variable.

OBJECT INTROSPECTION
====================

list-objects
  List the objects of the current instance.

  Objects are listed with their *id*, *type* and *version*.

info *id* | *all*
  Get information about a specific object or *all* objects.

  Requesting info about an object will also notify you of changes.

WORKING WITH REMOTES
====================

connect [*remote-name*]
  Connect to a remote instance and make this the new current
  instance.

  If no remote name is specified, a connection is made to
  the default remote instance, usually *pipewire-0*.

  The special remote name called *internal* can be used to connect to
  the local **pw-cli** PipeWire instance.

  This command returns a remote var that can be used to disconnect or
  switch remotes.

disconnect [*remote-var*]
  Disconnect from a *remote instance*.

  If no remote name is specified, the current instance is disconnected.

list-remotes
  List all *remote instances*.

switch-remote [*remote-var*]
  Make the specified *remote* the current instance.

  If no remote name is specified, the first instance is made current.

NODE MANAGEMENT
===============

create-node *factory-name* [*properties...*]
  Create a node from a factory in the current instance.

  Properties are key=value pairs separated by whitespace.

  This command returns a *node variable*.

export-node *node-id* [*remote-var*]
  Export a node from the local instance to the specified instance.
  When no instance is specified, the node will be exported to the current
  instance.

DEVICE MANAGEMENT
=================

create-device *factory-name* [*properties...*]
  Create a device from a factory in the current instance.

  Properties are key=value pairs separated by whitespace.

  This command returns a *device variable*.


LINK MANAGEMENT
===============

create-link *node-id* *port-id* *node-id* *port-id* [*properties...*]
  Create a link between 2 nodes and ports.

  Port *ids* can be *-1* to automatically select an available port.

  Properties are key=value pairs separated by whitespace.

  This command returns a *link variable*.

GLOBALS MANAGEMENT
==================

destroy *object-id*
  Destroy a global object.


PARAMETER MANAGEMENT
====================

enum-params *object-id* *param-id*
  Enumerate params of an object.

  *param-id* can also be given as the param short name.

set-param *object-id* *param-id* *param-json*
  Set param of an object.

  *param-id* can also be given as the param short name.

PERMISSION MANAGEMENT
=====================

permissions *client-id* *object-id* *permission*
  Set permissions for a client.

  *object-id* can be *-1* to set the default permissions.
